Creating dynamic slides in Stata
================================

### header 3 
- Dynamic slides are slides created for statistical representation and thus, 
includes code and output from Stata. 

- The __`markdoc`__ command allows you to 
easily create a _smcl log file_ and use it for creating dynamic analysis 
reports or even PDF slides. In this tutorial I will demonstrate how to quickly 
create the slides from Stata. Here are a few capabilities of the package. 


About MarkDoc
=============

#### Header 4

MarkDoc is a general purpose literate programming package that can export 
dynamic reports in several formats within Stata. However, this tutorial only 
demonstrates the dynamic slide feature. 

- Adding images and figures
- Interpreting mathematics
- creating PDF slides


How Does it Word?
=================

- Install MarkDoc (ssc install markdoc)
- Install a full LaTeX distribution
- Learn from this example!




How about mathematics?
======================

The dynamic slides are compiled with \LaTeX{} and naturally, 
\LaTeX{} mathematical notations are supported. Here is an example:

- $f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n$ 




How about Stata Output?
======================

You can execute any command and present the outputs as well!

tab price if price < 4000

How to create more slides?
==========================

Every heading creates a new slide. You can also use __#__ at the beginning of 
the line for creating a new slide




# How about wider Stata outputs

if you use commands that produce wider tables, reduce the __fontsize__ 
at the beginning of the document to keep the output within the document.
