Adding figures dynamically
==========================

- we previously used Markdown to include an image in the document
- The process was:
    1. saving a graph from Stata to the disk
    2. including the graph to the dynamic document
- This procedure can be further simplified, using the __`img`__ command
    1. Automatically capture the current graph from Stata and include it in the dynamic document
    2. Include a figure from the disk/internet in the dynamic document
    3. Resize the width and the height of the image in the dynamic document
    4. Align the image to the left (default) or center of the document
    5. Add a graph description

Syntax of `img` command
========================

Import graphical files in the dynamic document

    img [using filename] [, markup(str) title(str) width(int) height(int) left center ]

Automatically include the current graph from Stata in the dynamic document

    img [, markup(str) title(str) width(int) height(int) left center ]
