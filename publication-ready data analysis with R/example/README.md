Description
===========

This is a template for generating _publication-ready data analysis with R_ lecture,
for the Department of Psychology at University of Oslo. 

I am preparing this template to show:

1. How to organize a computational project
2. How to nest Rmarkdown files and run an entire data analysis within a single file called __MAIN.rmd__
3. How to produce a Microsoft Word document that is ready to be included in a manuscript:
4. The template demonstrates:
  + dynamic text paragraphs
  + dynamic figures and images
  + dynamic tables
5. There is also a section for automating __MPlus__ software within R. 
  + This section is deactivated but if you have __MPlus__ installed, give it a try! 


Running the analysis
---------------------

The __MAIN.rmd__ includes all the instructions for executing the analysis, examining the reproducibility of
the project, and generating the analysis report in Microsoft Word and HTML formats. 


Dependencies
---------------------

The package dependencies and the required software are mentioned at the outset of the __MAIN.rmd__ file


Data set
---------------------

The data documentation is can be found in `./dics/data.rdc` 

Variables of interest

Methodology
