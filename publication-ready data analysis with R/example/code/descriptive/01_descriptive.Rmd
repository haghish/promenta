Descriptive analysis
--------------------

Whether you should write the entire document here and produce a publication-ready
Microsoft Word or LaTeX document is up to you. The point is documenting 
what is carried out on the data and making all decisions trackable. 
Note that __interpretation__  of statistical analysis includes a number of 
decisions that a researcher makes. This is why combining interpretations with statistical 
code provide a clearer picture of what is going on in the data analysis.
